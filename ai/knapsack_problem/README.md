<h4>Get started</h4>
Python version used: 3.7.2
As requirement.txt file indicates, this project only needs xlsxwriter library installed

```pip install xlsxwriter```

or

```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the version I used.

bench.py is the main script. Run it as script from command line as below:

```python bench.py <number of random solutions wanted> <input_file>```
