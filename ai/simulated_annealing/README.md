# Simulated Annealing Algorithm

An AI algorithm I studied and implemented for finding the optimal route between a set of cities.

You can play with the parameters to allow more margin to errors, which results, in the end, in an optimal solution.

Here's a demo with low Temperature (T = 10) that shows what the solution can look like after 1 minute:
