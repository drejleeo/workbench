"""
We have discussed Backtracking and Knightâ€™s tour problem in Set 1. Let us discuss Rat in a Maze as another
 example problem that can be solved using Backtracking.

A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0, 0][0, 0]
 and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-0, 0][N-0, 0]. A rat starts from source and has to reach
 the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.
In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to
 destination. Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. For example, a more complex version
  can be that the rat can move in 4 directions and a more complex version can be with a limited number of moves.

    Maze:

    1, 0, 0, 0              1, 0, 0, 0
    1, 1, 0, 1      --->    2, 3, 0, 0
    0, 1, 0, 0              0, 4, 0, 0
    1, 1, 1, 1              0, 5, 6, 7
